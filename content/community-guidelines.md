Tealtribe has the following guidelines, any violation of these guidelines will be subject to [enforcement](#enforcement).

- Talk to other members with respect and kindness.
- Respect each other’s privacy. Don’t share anything said in a conversation outside of that conversation without consent.
- Shaming, discrimination, bullying and hate speech is not allowed.
- No nudity, sexual content or activities in the chat and/or video calls.
- While writing in the vent or other relevant chats give a *trigger waring* when the content would include descriptions of sexual abuse, violence, intense hate/anger.
- Try to understand the point of view of someone sending a message before imposing any other point of view onto them.
- Spam is not allowed. Spam has the following definitions unless these apply to the context of a conversation (meaning any of these are allowed if they are relevant to the context of the conversation): 
  - repetitive messages
  - advertisements
  - Lot's of external links in a short period of time
  - Provocative messages / Trolling
- Humor is encouraged in the designated chats. Darker and stereotyping humor is only allowed as long as it is not targeted to anyone in particular and is done without any ill intent or prejudice.
- Consciously get your needs met to the best of your ability. We promote using “Conscious transactions” as described in [Teal’s article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/transactional/) and resourcing [Teal’s article](://tealswan.com/resources/articles/resource-people/).
- Manipulation strategies are not allowed. Any manipulation must be addressed and the one manipulating has to be made aware of it. If a person continues to manipulate while being aware, they are in violation. Manipulation has the following definitions and can include other definitions as acknowledged by the medical psychological community:
  - Triangulation (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-triangle-from-hell-r309/))
  - Victim control dynamic (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-victim-control-dynamic-r251/))
  - Zero sum games (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-zero-sum-game-r366/))
  - Guilt tripping such as playing damsel in distress to get someone to get your needs met.
- When in a group call if you’d like to do a partswork or completion process, ask for consent from all the participants. If not everyone consents, move to a separate call with the people who would like to join.
- Interpersonal conflicts must be handled privately by all people involved and are not allowed to be held publicly but everyone is encouraged to ask the group for someone who can help mediate if needed.

## Enforcement
Please report any violation of the community guidelines to the admin through private chat or via email: [admin@tealtri.be](mailto:admin@tealtri.be).

The following actions will be taken when in violation:
- On the first notice the person will be granted a warning unless it's a severe violation such as imposing your sexuality onto someone in which case it'll be handled as if it is the second notice
- On the second notice the account and any other account this person may posses will be suspended until the person becomes aware of why they are choosing to violate the guidelines and clearly expresses how they are going to address the needs that need to be met in order not to violate the guidelines again.
- On the third notice the account and any other account (including future accounts) this person possesses will be removed.

Enforcement will come with reason and account for motive and will allow for a person to make a mistake and learn from it when the violation was unintended.

## Accountability
Any member is allowed to privately ask the admin for the reasoning behind any enforcement and non enforcement when upholding the guidelines.
