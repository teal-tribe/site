- Respect each others privacy, don't share anything said in a conversation outside of that conversation without consent.
- Spam is not allowed. Spam has the following definitions unless these apply to the context of a conversation (meaning any of these are allowed if they are relevant to the context of the conversation): 
  - repetitive messages
  - advertisements
  - Lot's of external links in a short period of time
  - Provocative messages / Trolling
- Shaming, Discrimination, bullying and hate speech is not allowed.
- Consciously get your needs met to the best of your ability (we promote using "Conscious transactions" as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/transactional/)).
  Manipulation strategies are not allowed.
  Any manipulation must be addressed and the one manipulating has to be made aware of it, if a person continues to manipulate while being aware they are in violation.
  Manipulation has the following definitions and can include other definitions that are acknowledged as manipulation by the medical psychological community:
  - Triangulation (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-triangle-from-hell-r309/))
  - Victim control dynamic (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-victim-control-dynamic-r251/))
  - Zero sum games (as described in [Teal's article](https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/the-zero-sum-game-r366/))
  - Guilt tripping which includes playing damsel in distress to get someone to get your needs met.
- Conflicts are handled privately by all people involved and aren't allowed to be held publicly. Anyone can ask the group for someone who can mediate if needed.
- Nudity and sexually explicit content and talk is only allowed in the designated _opt-in_ channel/chats/calls for it.
- While writing in the vent or other relevant channels give a _trigger waring_ when the content would include descriptions of sexual abuse, violence, intense hate/anger.
- When in a group call you'd like to do a partswork/completion process ask for consent from all the participants.
  If not everybody consents, move to a separate call with the people who would like to join/help.
- Humor is encouraged in the designated channels.
  Darker and stereotyping humor is allowed as long as it is not targeted to anyone in particular and is done without any ill intent or prejudice.

## Enforcement
Any violation of the community guidelines can be reported to the admin through the chat or via the email: [admin@tealtri.be](mailto:admin@tealtri.be). 
The following actions will be taken when in violation:
- On the first notice the person will be granted a warning unless it's a severe violation (such as imposing your sexuality onto someone) in which case it'll be handled as if it is the second notice
- On the second notice the account and any other account this person may posses will be suspended until the person becomes aware of why they are choosing to violate the guidelines and can tell how they are going to address the needs that need to be met in order not to violate the guidelines again.
- On the third notice the account and any other account (including future accounts) this person possesses will be removed.

Enforcement will come with reason and account for motive and will allow for a person to make a mistake and learn from it when the violation was unintended.

## Accountability
Any member is allowed to hold the admin accountable for maintaining these guidelines by questioning him and his actions publicly (in a public text channel in the chat).
However no one is allowed to call out the admin without asking for the reasoning of his decisions.

Any member is allowed to ask for the reasons of any enforcement or non enforcement privately.
In case of a public questioning any member is also allowed to do this publicly.
