Welcome to the Tealtribe website.
Here's a few things to know to get you started.

## The Finder
Have you ever wanted to meet Tealtribers in your neighbourhood but never knew where or how to find them?
![finder preview](/images/blogs/the-site/finder-preview.png)
In the finder you can share your social media accounts along side your closesed city location. 
This way people can search by location for people in their neighbourhood and have means to contact them (and setup a meetup).
In the finder you can also share your website and services you offer such as Certified Practitioned Completion Process (cpcp), Partswork, Astrology, etc.

When adding social accounts use either the url with your username in it such as "https://facebook.com/YourUsername" or just your username.
Don't use redirection links such as "https://vm.tiktok.com/Som3Und3$cr!bleC0de", These will not work.

## The chat
Yes, we get our own selfhosted chat!
This is an end-to-end encrypted selfhosted chat based on the [matrix protocol](https://matrix.org).

In order to login on your phone got to [the chat webpage](https://chat.tealtri.be), download the element app and when downloaded click the configure button , then in the app click "I already have an account" and then "login with tealtribe" in order to login. On the computer you can either use the chat in the browser or download [the element app](https://element.io/download), when in the app change the Homeserver clicking on the green "change" button and set the homeserver to "tealtri.be".
In once logged in you'll be in serveral chats and you can start chatting with your friends.

The finder and the chat work together, if you have shared your location people can see your socials along with a link to your chat.

Hope you'll be able to find one another on here!
If you have any questions feel free to contact the admin via [chat](https://link.tealtri.be/#/@jobstoit:tealtri.be) or mail [admin@tealtri.be](mailto:admin@tealtri.be).
