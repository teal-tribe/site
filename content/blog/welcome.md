Hey there dear triber!
Welcome to this tealtribe website, I hope you'll find many friends here and find the validation and the support that you'll need and deserve.

I'm Eli, a fellow triber, creator and maintainer of this website.
I wanted to build a place where Tealtribe people could speak censor-free about all the topics that interests us.
And on top of that I wanted to make it way more easy for tribers to find one another in real life or for specific support (such as a CPCP).
So I created a "[finder](/finder)" where any tribe member can add their closesed city location along with their socials.

On top of the finder I wanted to host a chat service, one that we as a community have control over (and not a big corporate entity).
Having our own chat service means that we can talk censor free, which means we could get into all kinds of crazy and not so crazy conspiracies without holding back.

It is my wish that Tealtribe people will unite, get our own and each others needs met to then thrive and make the world a better place by creating the things we wish to see in the world.

## Backstory
In case you're interested here's a little on why I felt the need to create this website(, it's a from pain/contrast to inspiration story).
I started watching Teals content back in 2017, I stumbled upon her video titled "How to feel" at a point where I felt really empty and depressed with litterally a google search "how to feel.
After that video soon more followed, and while I was first very sceptical of the more spiritual "woo woo" stuff I found her logic and reason in her explainations intriguing.
Frankly I was also all to fed up with the emptiness I felt that at that point I'd rather even explore "woo woo" options which is also why I kept listening.
And so being fasinated by her in dept explainations I started watching more and more of her video's.
I did however feel more alone than ever feeling like nobody understands this stuff and surely nobody in my neigborhood would validate any of it.
Back then I felt like I must have been the only person in the Netherlands that was watching her content.
Now life went on and while I continued to watch Teals content I was just waiting for her to come to the Netherlands again so I could find people who would understand.
So in 2019 I booked a ticket to the Amsterdam Synchonisation workshop of May 3th 2020.
![ticket](/images/blogs/welcome/ticket.jpeg)
I was set and ready to meet likeminded people, in fact my plan was to go there with just pens and papers and ask one of the event managers if I could announce the following idea:
_I want to organise a (annual) barbeque for tealtriber's in the Netherlands (somewhere central).
I have 2 paper's, one where 5 other people could add their name and email address who'd like to help me think about and setup this barbeque (the whereabouts and utilities).
And another paper(s) one where anyone who'd like to be notified of the gathering can add their email on that list._
But as we all know, at the end of 2019 the pandemic hit and Teal had to cancel her tour through Europe and thus I missed what was supposed to be my very first event.
So Teal started doing online events which wasn't as exciting as a live event, especially because I didn't get to meet people which was part of why I wanted to go to the event.
But at the end of the first event people started to invite people to join a Zoom call after the event to talk about it.
While being very nervous to join, I did.
I met lot's of wonderful people in there and it was such a relieve to have people to talk with who understood.
So after the event that followed I did invite people to join a call, but invited them to use [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) instead as anyone could just join from their browser without needing an account which lowers the bar for entry/participation and makes it more likely people would join.
People ended up creating a Whatsapp group which I also joined.
I invited people to show up the next week at the same time the event's started (10AM MST) and I'd be there on Jitsi.
So I showed up each week and each week I got to talk with likeminded people.
Being constent, each week more people joined (as people started expecting it) and we talked about topics like spirituality, astrology, partswork, what we each are going through ourselves and even did more and more partswork with one another.
I cannot stress how much of a relieve it was to finnally have people that understood and I could talk with (at least over text) every day.
I loved being understood but also being able to help people with what they were going through and also being able to recieve support from those people when I really needed it.
In the group also ended up being a few people from the Netherlands who I did end up meeting up with.
After the Whatsapp group became big I ended up being the admin for a discord server which is still active today and where I have a lot of friends.

I have seen and heard a lot of stories in the group that I was part of as well as a general in the Tealtribe that people feel lonely and seperated, feeling like they cannot get out of where they're at, feeling like they're all alone where they are.
I wanted to give you all an little push in the back to help you find likeminded people in your neighborhood.
I know that quite often we get stuck somewhere because we cannot see other possibilities or outcomes, quite often we need someone to bring some perspective or opportunities to get us to see that we aren't as stuck as we thought we were.
We thrive having people support us and have us ourselves support other people (I'd love for you to watch this TED talk as for me this feels so true: "[Isolation is the dream-killer, not your attitude | Barbara Sher | TEDxPrague](https://youtu.be/H2rG4Dg6xyI)").
That's why I created this little push in the back for the people of the Tealtribe, I hope it may give you the opportunities you didn't knew you had.

## What's next?
I'm still working on some smaller missing features for the website like support for profile picatures and an admin panel.
I'm thinking of maybe creating a tealtribe podcast too where we'd mainly talk about what interesting things we've learned from doing the (shadow) work and interesting developments that inspire us (and on the side also some astrology and conspiracies and aliens etc.). 
But that's a maybe, if that's something you're really passionate about and would like to do that than please feel free to contact me I'd love to support you.
After that... well that's up to us. Have any awesome idea's to bring more tealtribers together or support tribers?
Please let me know at [admin@tealtri.be](mailto:admin@tealtri.be)

Also, what would you like to see in a Tealtribe blog? Would you guys want to be able to write pieces in?
Should we have a "Triber of the month" mention for supportive carracters of our community?

I'd love to hear from you guys!

Lot's of love to you all.
